		<h4>Trapid is an online tool for the fast, reliable and user-friendly analysis of transcriptome data.</h4>
		<div class="subdiv">
		 	With the constant increase in sequencing power, brought forth by the next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, the post-sequencing analysis of the data has now become the major bottleneck. The growth of NGS data vastly outpaces the growth of computational processing power. The Trapid project was started to alleviate the majority of the problems associated with the downstream analysis of transcriptome data, and as such can play a major role in creating results in a faster and consistent manner.

		<h4>Trapid capabilities</h4>
		<div class="subdiv" style="padding-left:20px;">
		    <ul>
			<li>Allows each user to have up to 5 different working sets, each allowing up to a 100,000 putative transcripts</li>
			<li>Allows the user to select a reference database of choice. Current possibilies are PLAZA 2.5, Pico-PLAZA and OrthoMCLDB version 5.0</li>			
			<li>Assignes each transcript to a reference gene family or orthologous group.</li>
			<li>Transfers functional annotation based on homology/orthology for each transcript</li>
			<li>Performs gene family based analyzes such as multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree construction, with a selection of reference species of choice</li>	
			<li>Performs comparative analyzes such as as GO enrichment of subsets</li>
			<li>Extensive editing capabilities</li>	
		    </ul>
